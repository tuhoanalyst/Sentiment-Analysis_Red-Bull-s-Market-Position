22,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 22, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,"Breezeberry tastes like soap.

I primarily bought this because of the vibrant color of the Amazon images. The actual can does not look like this at all, looks like a low quality washed out screen print.

I have zero confidence in this brand. After I bought it I saw other people’s quality control complaints here, this seems to be a very dangerous brand — purchase at your own risk.

I’m sticking with Celsius."

Personally, I don't really care for the taste. I purchased the Cherry Slush flavor, and this tasted like cough syrup. I have no choice but drink this case since I bought it, but I most likely won't be buying this again. I'll edit this review if I feel differently later on after I've been drinking it for a while. As of right now, I am not a fan. It also has less caffeine than what I'm used to. I guess everything just isn't for everyone, and that's OK."

When I first ordered they were delivering overnight and NOW it take 2 weeks to get my purchase and there is NO option to pay to get sooner. The worst part is the tracking shows it's not even touched nor am I charged until day 10 after I ordered and then I'll get my package on day 12. Very disappointing!!"
107,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 13, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great product Terrible packaging,"The cases of drinks were dropped into a larger box which allowed the smaller case to move while being shipped. I presume someone at the carrier opened the box to see the contents that bouncing around because there was clear tape over the Amazon tape. After opening the brown box the original drink case was destroyed and I was missing a few cans.

Great product thought. Love the cherry slush flavor."

110,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 26, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, Bad Seller","Missing 2 of the cans!

After trying the cosmic stardust flavor (tastes like skittles!) I was interested in trying some of the other flavors this brand makes. The packaging of the 12 pack was very damaged and meant the cans were not very secured during shipping. Based on the damage the seller must have known it was this way before shipping. A damaged box isn't the end of the world when it comes to buying things on amazon but after further examining I noticed that I was only shipped 10 of the 12 cans."
111,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 22, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,Packaging,Love the product but disappointed with packaging.

136,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 16, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Half the package is the purple cans,"Disappointed with this purchase because I was not aware that half the package would be the purple cans rather than an even distribution of all three flavors. Since the blue can and white can are better flavors in my opinion than the purple, this was a huge disappointment. Nowhere on the packaging does it indicate that this would be the case. I feel that should at least be written on the packaging so folks are not misled the way I was.

Otherwise, the drinks were great as usual. Just wish it was more clear because I would have rather purchases a fully blue box than receive 6 purples and only three blue."

I can't say anything about the other flavors, but in my opinion the Cherry Slush flavor tasted so artificially sweet and gave me such a bad aftertaste. I am really disappointed in this flavor and I am sad that I now have 11 other cans that I probably won't be drinking. The flavor itself is good, not overly cherry-like but I can't get past the artificially sweet taste and the aftertaste that it gave me.

Alani’s first sip was extremely sweet and given that I had ordered a whole case, I was obliged to try it at least more than 2-3 times. I have gone through 4 cans now and each and every time, I am extremely saddened by how people can drink this 0 sugar / aspartame like drink that tastes wayyyy too sweet. Blueberry flavor definitely gave me the blues. So sorry, but I am on to find the next bevy that won’t make me feel like I’m drinking a high fructose blue drink."

205,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"April 11, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product bad delivery,"The product is good. But the packaging was not. The box that the alani nu came in was broken and ripped. All of the cans had some kind a dent on them. Then it was all put in a bigger box to hold it. On top of all that, it was the wrong flavor."
206,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"April 4, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Drinks are good,"The drinks are great, my issue was my box was absolutely destroyed and the cans were lose in the package."
207,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 29, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Drink good but packaged badly,Drink is good but the seller I got it from was not that great. The box was kinda crushed and one of the drinks was empty it must have busted and leaked out
208,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 27, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Received damage package,I opened my box of alanis and 3 of the 12 are damaged. It says there is no refund or item replacements available for this item. I buy this item on a regular basis but to have squatter of them damaged at no fault of my own and not be able to get a replacement is very frustrating
209,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 26, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Alani nuuu thank you.,"I ordered the variety pack the reason I know about alani is because I saw a lot of fitness YouTubers drinking the product and was curious to try it, and the only thing I can say is ......it's ok, it's not bad but it just taste so sweet it's almost hard to believe it has ""10"" calories the first sip taste good but. I wouldn't keep drinking it, also there is a uneven mix of the cans there are 6 cans of cosmic blast, and only 3 of the others they could have did four each...so I don't know why they decided to give a weird like I said uneven amount, but besides that IF you have a sweet tooth and I MEAN SWEET TOOTH extremely then I, would gladly recommend."

213,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 20, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Box was open,I’m more bothered by the fact that when I open the box The Alani nu box was and cans were banging around in the package
214,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 18, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,They all overflowed/exploded when I opened them,"I’ve gotten these multiple times but for some reason this entire pack when cracked, would fizz and overflow a lot. And they definitely weren’t recently shaken or bumped or anything before I opened them. They still tasted fine after they stopped fizzing everywhere but the batch seemed weird."
215,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 15, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Really strong taste,You will defijitely love it or hate it. It’s a very strong flavor. Not my personal favorite but I mixed with some plain seltzer and enjoyed that much more.
216,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 13, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Can exploded in package,Product is great but in route to me one of the cans exploded and as you can guess it made a big mess. Not sure why this happened and who is to blame.
217,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 11, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,/:,I love the alani nu energy drinks. I buy them on Amazon all the time. This time the pack I bought seems defective. Every can I have opened from this pack have exploded to the point where half of the can is missing and the rest has no carbonation :( tried to contact seller and was not even able to report issue
218,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 7, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor packaging,Most of the cans were dented and the box was ripped apart prior to opening. Concerned with safety of dented cans. Alani is my favorite energy drinks despite the delivery.

The box was holding on by a thread to stay closed. The cans were broken out of Alani box scattered and shaken in the Amazon box. The product is fine. Shipping needs improvement
220,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 3, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a huge Alani fan, but these taste more like cherry!","I am a huge fan of Alani products, especially their cosmic stardust energy drink flavor! I ordered these hoping to find another flavor I could enjoy but was a bit disappointed it tasted more like cherry to me! I am a huge watermelon fan but I almost despise cherry. I still drank them, its not a strong cherry taste but definitely more cherry flavor than watermelon!

I enjoy Alani's 12 pack prices though!"
221,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 22, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,COSMIC STARDUST IS THE BEST!! CHERRY SLUSH ON THE OTHER HAND..,"I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH COSMIC STARDUST. I diverted to a different flavor because there was a 20$ increase in the flavor that I originally got. I heard great things about cherry stardust and I know that taste is subjective, but it isn't very pleasant. I would not recommend this flavor whatsoever, it tastes like cough medicine. Also, I came to write a review about the prices. Energy drinks should not be 40$ for a pack of 12. I hope this changes soon"
222,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 13, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as the other flavors,"The taste was ok, more of a faint orange taste. Definitely not their best flavor. As for the caffeine, woke me up just like the others. Not terrible, but personally wouldnt buy again."
223,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 9, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Drinks fizz over when opened,"Every single can that I have opened has fizzed over and made a mess.

225,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 23, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,I got this item because it was supposed to be a Variety pack well I got 3 watermelon 2 blueberry and the 7 the other one. I was thinking ong really this is not really a variety pack when u get a lot more of the same flavor. If I really wanted the same flavor I would had bought that flavor. Not worth the money you spend on this pack. Just order the other flavor by itself.
226,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 19, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Over Carbonated,"Bought these twice and both times they came to me, there was an over carbonation. The actual product was great, but when opening the can the carbonation would explode no matter how long I let the cans sit resulting in a loss of 1/4 of the product."
227,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 18, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Way too sweet!,"In order to drink this, I put it in the blender over ice, let it sit for a minute or so to make sure the carbonation doesn’t explode in my blender! It’s similar to a frozen cherry slurped. I probably would not buy this one again. Still looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good! This one has some ingredients that I’m not fond of for my health. I prefer “Methylcobalamin” for starters. I’ll keep searching…"
228,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"December 31, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Delicious but delivery is horrible,"I love these and I drink one every morning, so I have them on auto delivery. The box ALWAYS arrives damaged, as well as the cans, but the most recent box had been taped shut like someone dropped it then tried to fix it. All the cans are dented and explode when I open them, and I lose a good quarter of the drink. Shipping issues need to be resolved."

233,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 23, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t set up 6 week or more re-purchase,"The drinks are great, and I wish I could’ve kept getting them. However, the price was increased and I never was charged or told I wouldn’t be receiving the product within 6 weeks. When attempting to figure out the reasoning, there was nothing I could do. Would recommend not setting up a recurring order."
234,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 1, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but got uneven number of flavors,"Updated to add: for my second shipment of this box, I received SIX purple cosmic flavor cans and only 3 of the others. Weirdly uneven flavor distribution AGAIN.

Ended up getting 5 of the purple cosmic flavor and only 3 blue for some reason lol"
235,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 19, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged,"I love Alani Nu energy drinks & ordered 2 flavors of these when they were a prime day deal. They were shipped in 2 different packages & delivered at different times, but both boxes of drinks came damaged. The 1 delivered in the larger package was completely opened, cans were out of the box & some of the cans were leaking on everything else in the package. I’d think it was an issue with delivery if it hadn’t happened in 2 separate deliveries."
236,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 19, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Banged up and leaking,I love these drinks but I can't make a complaint about some of the cans being punctured and leaking in the mail room.

237,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 12, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Basically good,Good taste but caused me heartburn so could not drink

242,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 15, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged,"Typically do not leave reviews, however, I do think it’s important to note that saving money to receive damaged goods doesn’t actually save money in the end.

245,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 1, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Variety?,"You would think in a variety pack of 12 cans with 3 different flavors that you would receive 4 cans of each flavor. That is not the case with this variety pack. I received 6 of the Cosmic Stardust and 3 of the other 2 flavors. And silly me, Cosmic Stardust isn’t my favorite flavor but I thought it would be fine in a small amount, but it was the majority so, I will not be purchasing this variety pack again."
246,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 20, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good flavor, found an empty can in my box though",I’m not sure if this is a common issue but just a heads up you might receive an empty can

252,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 17, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Different label makes me nervous,I absolutely LOVEEE Alani and drink them everyday. It’s getting harder to find them in our stores so I ordered them off here but I’m nervous to drink it honestly. They label is different . Normal cans from the store the label is printed on the can but these have a physical sticker label . Has anyone ever come across this? The can on the right is the can ordered on Amazon.

The can was crumpled on arrival and was difficult to open up, so we didn’t feel comfortable drinking them with it seeming compromised"

261,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 3, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,4 of the 12 were empty.…this is too expensive of a product for 1/3 of them to be ruined.,There was no evidence of leaking…4 of 12 cans were empty
262,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 30, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Um. I love Alani, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.","I absolutely love Cosmic Stardust. It is my favorite flavor. The caffeine content is perfect for me and I don’t have jitters or anything like that. But man, the drinks are literally out in a white plastic with no protection. The cans come bent, leaking, and sticky. 12 cans -5 are bent and of those 5, 2 are leaking.
At this rate it’s not worth the money you save buying them on Amazon versus going to your local Kroger and spending a little more to receive 12 cans that aren’t damaged."
263,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 12, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Half Filled Cans,Four cans in the one dozen pack were only half filled. This is the second time this happened!

I decided to give this flavor a try and shipping was super fast but when I opened the case 4 cans were busted. Super disappointing since I cant even get the option for a replacement
265,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 13, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love product but please fix Packaging!,Love this product but all cans were sticky probably due to this busted can. :(
266,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 12, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Some of the Cans were half filled,"The drink tastes really nice and I honestly think it’s good, but the packaging is REALLY BAD. Turn your sound up while watching the video I posted with this review, so you can hear the amount of drink in the half filled products (half filled is honestly an overstatement because the amount of drink was smaller than half) and the filled ones. The fact that 2 out of 12 were half filled is CRAZY.

Also, there was some smelly yellow liquid on the top of the cans and that kind of freaked me out a little bit because I saw a video that showed some workers urinating on packaged drinks like this one.

I don’t recommend this seller to anyone but I still think the product itself is good, the packaging is just horrendous."
267,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love but,"I love these drinks. I found these on Amazon to be a clutter cheaper than buying in the stores buttttt for done reason the ones in the store is a little more tasteful where you can really taste the tart and these were really flat. I barely can taste it. Kinda had me wondering if these were authentic. The can was a little different as well . The one on the left is the one I get from target , the one on the right is Amazon. But ok with the purchase and I think they are fake"

At first everything was fine however I noticed when I would drink them everyday, I would start to have difficulty breathing for a few hours afterwards. I think I have a slight allergic reaction to them that only happens when I drink them for multiple days in a row (only one a day). Overall the flavors nice and I'd definitely order them again if I didn't have that reaction to them."

272,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"August 31, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Variety pack is misleading,"First off, I like the flavors which is why I ordered them. I usually buy in stores but I wanted to get a variety pack as stores don’t have all the flavors. I am unhappy with how the product came because this appears to be a box that was ripped open, not during transport, but either by another customer that returned it or before packing. I’ll be returning for this reason, who knows who has touched them! Also, a 12 pack of variety cans, you would think 4 of each flavor? No. I got 6 of cosmic stardust and 3 each of the two others."

This was my first time ordering a case and a lot of the cans were very damaged and dented up. I also buy Celsius by the case and have never had a problem like this. Hopefully this is a one time thing.
276,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Tastes the same,"I thought all of these tasted the same. They all taste like smarties candy. The carbonation is nice, but flavor is eh."
277,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 18, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love these but came damaged,I love these drinks and have them on a subscription because my boyfriend and I drink them so often. They are our morning coffee. But this last shipment came with 2 broken and half empty cans. The only thing they offer to do it return it and they will replace it but that’s such a hassle and we had already drank some of the other cans before noticing these 2 half empty ones. Just wish they would check them before or offer a better solution. Overall good flavor and drink just bad delivery experience. This has happened once before too with a different drink.
278,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 13, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Hurt my stomach,After drinking one of these for a few days in a row my stomach started feeling poor and I ended up getting sick for a few days. Not sure if this is just me being sensitive to whatever’s in it but I’m usually fine with caffeine. Also label looks wonky like it’s printed on w paper vs the ones in the store. Tastes soooooooooooo good though.
279,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"July 5, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as watermelon,"Tasted like a melted popsicle and the cans came bent up. So bent up in fact that they were hard to open with the tab.
Watermelon wave is 10x better.
Still got the job done and gave me energy without jitters. Just wasn’t my favorite flavor"

Everything is great, though it's a bit expensive, I was just bummed out that some cans in the pack got dinged up in transit and couldn't be opened without exploding =/"
281,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love these drinks but...,These are great drinks. Not too much caffeine and jitters after drinking and cherry slush is my favorite flavor. The only complaint I have is the cans come damaged. The cans they use are very brittle and seem to leak with shipping and handling. 2 of the 12 we're completely empty and carbonation was low on a few others. They really need to pay attention to packing quality as these drinks are not as cheap as others.

I love alani nu and I love all the flavors ive tried so far, so I thought I'd give the variety pack a try. But this Cosmic flavor is not my jam. It's a very strong artifical grape flavor. If that's you're thing, you'll love it. For me, 5.9 cans out of 12 ended up in the trash."

289,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 10, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Can bent some busted,"Love this product but it wasn’t packaged very well. Half of the cans were damaged, unable to consume and unable to return due to Amazon policy"
290,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 16, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Flat,This is my absolute favorite flavor of these drinks so when I found a 12 pack on Amazon I bought them right away! The first one I had tasted…off but didn’t think too much of it. Me and my husband both had one a day or so later and realized the off flavor was that they were flat. They tasted like a 2 liter of soda that had been sitting opened for days in the fridge. Not good and not sure how they could turn out like this. Hoping it was just this batch and if I order again they’ll taste like normal!
291,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 13, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Hmmm....,It seemed sweeter than the ones I have bought in store.... Also.... this had like... a plastic wrap around the cans..... the ones I buy in store have no wrap on the can... just makes me wonder..... are they imposters??

293,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 1, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smashed cans,"Flavor - 10/10. One of my favorite flavors of the Alani energy drinks. However, I have 3 stars for how I received almost 1/3 of my cans. 1 can top is almost completely smashed and the other ones have definitely seen better days. I’m honestly slightly surprised the smashed ones did not leak or explode in the packaging."

300,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"April 14, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wrong shipment,I ordered orange kiss but received mimosa. Unfortunately this item cannot be returned. I love Alani so this is a bummer
301,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"April 4, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product but hate the shipping,"I love this product I think it’s by far the best flavor and energy drink out there. I was having trouble finding it at the store so decided to get through Amazon and this is what was delivered. I’m so upset. 1 can was opened and spilled out, about 4 other cans are beat up and I can’t replace or return them. They just aren’t packaged well, so I’m not sure if I’ll order these again or keep searching the stores."
302,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 2, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but shipping is so bad","The drink it's self is delicious, the cherry is almost overly sweet. Almost. Not quite. The energy boost is amazingly clean if I sip 1-2 through the day (less caffeine than if I just hit up coffee and tea. Yes, I have a high tolerance). I don't crash like I do from coffee or Bang. Don't chug this unless you are a mummy rising from the crypt. Too much too quick will give you a bad time.

I have had something go wrong with 3 orders in a row, in less than a week. The first one never got to me or my building. The second was shipped in a box bigger than the case with zero packaging. The case broke, the cans were just bouncing around and ofc cans broke open. The third was damaged while out for delivery and could not be delivered.
I have had back luck getting these delivered, but I also don't have a better option to buy them from."

305,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 28, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tasty!,Much more tasty than other energy drinks with orange flavors such as celsius. This drink truly is a perfect morning treat and gives a good boost of energy!
306,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 16, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tastes delicious!,"Great flavor, reminds me a bit of rainbow unicorn from bang energy if I remember correctly. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because the box came already opened and quite a few of the cans were deformed, obviously packed and shipped that way since the Amazon box wasn't damaged."
307,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"February 14, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Only 4/5 stars because the box the cans arrived in came seemingly bursted open. Other than that they are great.
308,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 21, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Out of date product,I received these on March 21st and they expired on the 23rd. Every can that we have opened has spewed everywhere and the taste is also off. i just realized yesterday that they were all expired. I would like a refund please because we have not been able to drink any of them.
309,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 6, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Yum!,After trying the flavor in the purple can I gave this flavor a try. It was very good. I buy this brand when I see it on sale to save a few bucks but all the flavors I've tried are good.
310,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 4, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Yum if you afford it,VERY Delicious but sadly unaffordable.
311,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"December 30, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Got a weird batch,"I buy this all the time and never had issues until this most recent shipment, the ones I got tasted SO off. This is my favorite energy drink and this batch I got tastes weird/old/flat. Given it’s the same for all of them in the package :/ still giving 4 stars since I normally don’t have issues. Hopefully it’s a one time thing, I can’t even finish it it’s so gross"
312,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"December 13, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for night shift,This is perfect for night shift. It tastes great and I’m always looking forward to it! Price is a little high but it’s cheaper per can if you buy the case
313,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"December 8, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tastes fresh, carbonated and amazing!!!","I would definitely say I love the Blue Slush the best and this flavor is the next second. I had problems with the second blue slush order having many bent cans from falling in package prior to be putting in an Amazon box so we lost 5 of them that don’t open correctly and lost money so that is extremely disappointing.

This flavor has outstanding reviews but steer clear of it if you have acid reflux issues because this flavor is a huge trigger for me and though I absolutely love the flavor I have had bad acid reflux and a stomach ache for 6 hours after drinking them.

I don’t have this problem though with the Blue Slush flavor."
314,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"December 3, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pricey but goid,Easy as it is difficult to find
315,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 26, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good taste,Gave me lots of energy and had a good taste. It gave me heart burn though so I don’t drink it as often now.
316,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 9, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value,"Its a good flavor, and more healthy. Im trying to cut back on redbull as its given me kidney stones. But its been much harder then i thought. This is a good healthy substitute, but its not redbull. :("
317,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"November 7, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite caffeine drink,"I found the Alani Nu Cherry by accident and fell in love with it immediately. I do NOT drink sugar laden drinks. And other diet sodas taste off to me. I like to pop one of these cans of Alani Nu Cherry into the freezer for about 30 minutes to get it slushy. It tastes exactly like a Cherry Icee but without all those calories! My local grocery store only sells them in singles and they seem to ALWAYS only have 1 or 2 if they’re not completely out. So I purchase these by the case In subscription mode from Amazon. Now I don’t have to hunt for 1 or 2 at a time and they come straight to my home. Win-win!
My only complaint is they need to be packaged a bit better with more protective cushioning. As my last box, 10 of the 12 cans the tops were misshapen from being dropped/mashed making it very difficult to open the pull top tab."
318,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 24, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Did something change?,"I've been drinking Cosmic Stardust for over two years now. This last order was different. The drink itself is noticably lighter in color. See, I bring cans to work and share with coworkers by pouring them into small, clear cups. So I know what the color is supposed to look like. Like a vibrant pink color. These ones are a really pale pink. It didn't even really taste the same. All the previous ones I've had tasted almost exactly like Skittles. These have like a hint on that taste, but they aren't expired or anything, according to the printed date on the bottom of the cans. But the color is way off, and the taste is meh on this last pack I got. Makes me a bit wary.."
319,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 8, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tastes great,"I was tired of buying them at the store so I ordered them here, tastes the same and was a better deal. I like that it gives me energy to make it through the day."
320,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 26, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly just Cosmic Stardust,"My variety pack only came with 2 breezeberry, 2 watermelon, and the rest were cosmic stardust. If I wanted just cosmic stardust, I would have been way cheaper… get the individual flavor packs to save money because the variety is overpriced and you don’t get what is listed."
321,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 25, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good drink,"It was not my first choice in flavors, but I got quite a few cans for the price I paid."

323,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"September 14, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great tasting.,Get tasting. Not the healthiest of ingredients but lots of caffeine. Box arrived with cans all over as shown in the picture. Kind of expensive for the type of ingredients used but good taste and caffeine content.
324,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"August 25, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Odd Number of Drinks???,"okay so the cosmic stardust is my favourite, so im not upset but like??? 12 cans, right?? 3 flavours? wouldn;'t it make more sense to have four of each flavour? so the number of each flavour of drinks just threw me off, but other than that they're good. for some reason i thought i got a 24 pack, but that's my bad for misreading. not sure if i'd pay nearly 30 USD for just twelve cans again."
325,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"August 4, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great drink,I love this drink and I cannot find them in stores so I order them from Amazon. But when I opened the box a few of my drinks was empty. It looked like they was sliced at the bottom(not on purpose I'm sure). No way to get in touch with the seller.
326,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"August 3, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Missing a drink,I love these drinks. But I paid for a 12 pack and only received 11….doesn’t let me return so hopefully you guys could ship me an extra?
327,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 13, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but pricey,"I love the drinks, would give them 5 stars if they weren’t so expensive. If the cost comes down I will get them again."
328,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 11, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tastes amazing, but expensive for a 12oz drink","These taste great, definitely a tropical vibe. No weird aftertaste or anything. I gave four stars because the price for 12 of these cans when they are only 12 ounces was pretty steep. Rockstar has many great flavors that come in a 16 ounce can with 12 cans for less than these. Probably won't buy again unless the price drops significantly."
329,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 10, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,I’m very picky when it comes to energy drinks but I like this one tastes like grape soda. Doesn’t really give me any extra energy but it’s pretty good for a zero sugar beverage.
330,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"June 1, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is great - Amazon's shipping leaves a lot to be desired,"The product is great, the combination of flavor hits the right notes - not too sweet, not too tart. It's just the shipping I take exception with. The cardboard cases do not hold up - they will split open when you pick them up. I have this on subscribe and save and Amazon throws it in with other things that can get damaged by the weight. They use to ship these out in a cardboard box with plastic wrap which was much better but the current packaging doesn't hold up."
331,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"May 25, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"I never thought that a sugar-free energy drink could actually taste good, until I tried Alani Nu's Breezeberry flavor. This pre-workout performance drink comes in a convenient 12 oz can, and it's packed with caffeine, taurine, and a blend of vitamins and minerals.

But what really surprised me was how refreshing and delicious the Breezeberry flavor is. It's not overly sweet or artificial tasting like some other energy drinks on the market. Instead, it has a subtle berry flavor with a hint of citrus, which is perfect for a mid-day pick-me-up or a pre-workout boost.

I was also impressed with the energy boost I got from drinking this Alani Nu energy drink. It gave me a sustained level of energy without making me feel jittery or anxious. And since it's sugar-free and only has 10 calories per serving, I didn't have to worry about any sugar crashes or extra calories.

Overall, I would highly recommend Alani Nu Sugar-Free Energy Drink, Pre-Workout Performance, Breezeberry, 12 oz Cans (Pack of 12) to anyone looking for a tasty, low-calorie energy boost. It's a game changer for me!"

336,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 18, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Disproportionate Product,"The 12-pack “Fruit Blast” does not advertise more than one flavor than the other.

One person likes the purple comic stardust more, although are unsure what it is supposed to taste like. One likes the blue razz the most. This is a good product and the cleanness of the drink is high. It is more expensive than other drinks though.

Personally, I enjoy other energy drinks over this one and they have better prices as well. I would purchase this again, especially if it were on sale!! It is not my top pick, however."

I have tried many different kinds so when I stubbled upon this brand I had to try it. First, they are pretty pricey espescially for the size and caffeine content. I liked that they were sugar free about they tatse sugar free as well. There is also a lingering vitamin taste. I don't know if I will try them again. I might try an different flavor to see if anything changes. This tatsted like a sugar free red gatorade with an aftertaste."

364,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 7, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good alternative but pricey for the smaller cans.,"Cherry Slush is on point with the flavor. Especially when almost frozen. But did carry an odd aftertaste.
The 200mg of caffeine kinda sneaks up instead of the KER-POW of the brands with 300mg.
But I would not even closely classify it as a ""pre workout"" as advertised.
Amazon price of $29.99 for a case of 12 of Alani is retail. Can get cases of 16oz cans of other big brands near $20 most times. So for 12oz Alani at $30, no real savings versus box stores that carry these. Just the stores near us never stocked the Cherry Slush, so ""pay to play"" as the saying goes."

374,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"October 5, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great energy drink,"My local gym stocks this brand of energy drink in the vending machine. I was able to try the Rainbow Candy and Mimosa flavors from there. I LOVE the rainbow candy, tastes just like liquid skittles. The Mimosa tastes just like a fizzy mimosa and I really didn't care for that flavor. I purchased the Cosmic Stardust because it was included in shipping. I really don't care for the flavor either. Tastes like watered down grape. So I just ordered the rainbow candy as it's worth the extra shipping cost. Overall the caffeine doesn't make me feel jittery and doesn't interfere with falling asleep at night so I really enjoyed the extra energy boost from this product. The package came quickly and well wrapped."

Don’t get me wrong, it tastes pretty good and it seems to give me a decent energy boost but I wasn’t blown away by the flavor like some people are. To me, it kind of tastes like diet watered down orange soda. I like them but not sure Id order them again"

- unique and tasty flavors (Hawaiian Shaved Ice)
- health(ier) alternative to other brands (10 calories per can amongst other ingredients)
- 200mg of caffeine
- energy is a natural and smooth onset, no headaches/jaw stiffness or anxious/jumpiness
- doesn't feel super carbonated upon consumption

The only negatives (for me) are the price. I bought a single can at a grocery store for ~$2.40. Purchasing a 12 pack, I am still getting them for ~$2.30 a piece. And now it isn't even eligible for Prime shipping :(
It isn't the biggest dealbreaker but a factor some customers value.

I would still recommend this for anyone wanting to try it out!"

435,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"March 13, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Refreshing, Energizing, and My Go-To Drink!","I've been on the hunt for the perfect energy drink for quite some time, one that not only gives me that much-needed boost but also aligns with my health and wellness goals. After trying all the flavors Alani Nu has to offer, the Mimosa flavor has firmly established itself as my all-time favorite.

What sets the Alani Nu Mimosa apart for me is its impeccable balance of taste and functionality. The flavor is refreshing and invigorating, perfectly mimicking the essence of a real mimosa - minus the alcohol, of course. It's my morning ritual before workouts, providing me with 200mg of caffeine to power through intense sessions without any jitters or crash afterwards.

Another significant plus is the nutritional profile. With zero sugar, only 10 calories, and a blend of antioxidants, biotin, and B vitamins, it's guilt-free indulgence at its finest. It's not often you find an energy drink that supports your energy levels, contributes to your nutritional needs, and tastes great all at once.

Whether you're looking for a pre-workout boost, an afternoon pick-me-up, or a delicious beverage to start your day, Alani Nu Mimosa has got you covered. It's a stellar example of what a modern energy drink can be: effective, healthy, and downright delicious. Five stars all the way!"

GNC actually reached out and responded with a reasonable solution. Customer service representative was extremely kind and quick to respond. For one off shipping mishaps they handle the situation in a reasonable manner and would recommend them to others in future.
Prior review:
I have ordered 14 times in past and never had a problem, this time my order came destroyed as an understatement. It also showed as being shipped via FedEx from a GNC store instead of Amazon. Will be ordering directly from Alani Nu or going to a store in future. It’s too expensive to arrive damaged and not get customer service or partial refund."

473,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 31, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Delish but explodes 90% of the time upon opening,I live off these things and they are my favorite. I’m not sure if anyone else has this problem but 4 out of the 5 boxes I’ve ordered have been over carbonated and explode when I open them. Still love them though still gonna buy them.

I love being able to buy them in bulk - and I feel that Amazon has the best pricing for them."
486,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 19, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Favorite,I absolutely live this flavor and love that sometimes it's offered discounted through Amazon. It always comes quickly and in excellent condition.
487,Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Alani Energy Drink,"January 17, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent with a noticeable difference in taste. Somewhat KETO friendly.,"For those on Keto, it should be noted that these range in carbs from 4g to 6g.

The Breezeberry is my favorite, it is somewhat strong in taste and has a ""mixed berry"" like flavor. The Watermelon drink is the most subtle (and has the most carbs) while the Cosmic Stardust has a rather sweet strawberry-like taste (Similar to its color, the BreezeBerry, and the Watermelon Wave are mostly clear in color and the same (pictured, like Squirt)).

These cans each contain more than 2 cups of standard coffee along with other energy drink standbys like Taurine and Panax Ginseng as well as some vitamins.

Overall, for the cost these are a great purchase and I look forward to ordering again and trying the other flavors.
