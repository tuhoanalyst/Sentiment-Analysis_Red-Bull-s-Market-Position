It is a great low calorie option for an energy drink and helps to support my energy levels while I run kids around to their events all day long. However, I am very frustrated that multiple shipments I have received contain cans with holes in them. I don't know when this is happening during the supply chain process but it is very frustrating. I provided a picture of a can from the last case I received. That is a huge hole over the ingredients list! The drink was over every can in the case. I don't know if Amazon needs to put fragile on the box or if inspections are needed by C4 but I would really appreciate it if someone could look into this. I don't want to switch from Amazon autoships or from drinking C4 but something has to change. This is a waste of my money!"

Unfortunately, I had to stop using these, and it is unfortunate, because the focus that comes from drinking these along with the pre-workout benefit is significant. However, sucralose completely destroyed blood sugar control and insulin control, and studies suggest it is terrible (toxic)for the human body. No one should drink sucralose ever. Especially when products such as monk fruit sweetener in erythritol exist.

Sucralose:

Gut Health: Some research has indicated that sucralose might negatively affect the balance of bacteria in the gut, reducing the number of good bacteria and increasing the pH level. However, these studies were primarily conducted on rats, so it's unclear if these effects are the same in humans.

Glucose Metabolism: There are also concerns about the impact of sucralose on glucose metabolism. Some studies suggest that it might affect insulin and blood sugar levels, leading to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, further research is needed to establish this conclusively.

Taste Perception: Regular consumption of artificial sweeteners like sucralose can also potentially alter taste perception, making naturally sweet foods (such as fruits) taste less appealing, which could lead to poor dietary choices.

Potassium Sorbate:

Allergic Reactions: Some people may experience allergic reactions to potassium sorbate, with symptoms like skin rashes, itching, or respiratory problems. These reactions, however, are quite rare.

Potential Carcinogen: There are also concerns that when potassium sorbate reacts with certain substances (like ascorbic acid), it might form a mutagenic compound known as a 'sorbic acid compound,' which could potentially lead to genetic mutations and cancer. But the evidence on this is quite limited and more research is needed to confirm this.

Digestive Issues: Some people might experience digestive issues like nausea, diarrhea, or nutrient malabsorption after consuming food products with potassium sorbate. However, these effects are generally associated with the consumption of this additive in large quantities.

Two weeks have passed since the incident, and today I took three sips from the can, and I started feeling nauseous again. It's not the caffeine; I'm someone who drinks a lot of coffee (and I clarify that I hadn't had any coffee before drinking the C4)."

Wrong items.,"I've been ordering this brand for a while now by the case each time. Like the starburst flavors and the pricing is decent when it's around $22-23 (on sale). I placed an order and it arrived next day. When I opened the box I didn't even realize it was the wrong item till I picked up a can from the case and noticed it was a 12oz can (the girth didn't feel right) this is how I noticed. Not just the wrong flavor. Someone somewhere at Amazon or C4 isn't doing validation or following procedures correctly. The weight and size of the 12oz case is not the same as a 16oz case. Wrong size, wrong flavor, wrong weight. So no employee caught this and no Amazon systems caught this.

When the item is correct it's great. I love the brand, the flavors, the performance, the price. Just this specific time someone really messed up. Thankfully Amazon's AI support issued me a refund and let me keep the wrong item due to the fact that they won't accept a return on it. So I'll use the credit and try buy another case and hope for the best.

Side note - I tried to order a case of the skittle flavor twice. Both times it said ""preparing for shipping"" with an ETA for 2 days, but never shipped. So something is going on at Amazon with the products not being available from the vendor. Use caution."

One was lost entirely and the lemon case had 3 damaged cans and soaked packaging
My rating would be higher if there was a more clear way to contact customer service at cellucor to get some kind of partial refund, but I wasn't able to see anything at my first pass on the website

Definitely don't bank on these shipping intact or at all. I suggest getting their powder pre-work out as a kind of backup if you choose these as your main pre-work out

The Strawberry and Cherry are on point for Starburst flavor. Lemon was close enough, and I haven't tried the Orange yet.
The Skittles flavor kinda tastes like a generic candy flavor? But I could also be way off on remembering what they taste like since I haven't had them in years üòÇ"

They were probably on sale at my local grocery store and I developed an expensive habit.
I used to use the powdered pre-workout stuff, and noticed that no matter how much I shook my bottle, there was always a gritty presence, and frankly, when you're thirsty, you don't need that.
I should be transparent though - I don't use this as a true pre-workout. Sometimes I use it mid-workout. 16 ounces is a large portion, and there's more caffeine than what I really need, so I stretch it out through the morning.
I like the flavor compared to other canned pre-workouts. Monster, Bang, Ghost - those are truly awful tasting, the ones I tried. And frankly, other than the Strawberry Watermelon, C4's flavors are also truly awful. The Orange Slice is my preference.
I'm only writing a review to share that I've gotten this product direct from Cellucor with their subscription - and those cans come in good shape. The ones I got from Amazon here...well, half of them are disfigured. Not punctured, but they got dented in such a way that it makes it difficult to set them on a table, as the bottom will be bowed out on some cans, and on some others, the top is messed up and the can is difficult to open without breaking the tab off. Not a fan of using a glass, so that's why I dock them a star on the overall rating. I still think they are too expensive for what you get, but everything is priced to support someone's drug habit these days."

I read reviews before on here that say they always come damaged, but i had never had that issue before until now! 3 of the 12 cans came damaged and actually emptied out. The box should be marked fragile or something so that delivery drivers are more careful, or package the product in a way that provides more cushion to withstand the rough transit.

I also love how many flavor combinations they offer as we have bought many different ones to rotate while drinking.

Our house is divided though as I am not a huge fan of the taste. I get too much sweetness and too much fake sugar. I cannot even drink a smaller can. He on the other hand loves them and has not found a flavor he does not like.

These come in smaller and larger cans as well. We both prefer the smaller can as the larger one is a lot to drink.

Overall, we will still buy them again and again though for my hsuband."

Bang has several flavors, as does Reign, and there are many others. I tried this one based on the claim it tasted like Skittles. It is sweet, but not much of a Skittles taste to me. Not sure how much caffeine there is either, since I can drink a can before going to bed and sleep like a baby (except for the thumb sucking, crying, and bed wetting part), but I may just be tolerant to caffeine by now. More energy is something I have to do myself, to mentally amp myself to the point of feeling it. Can't really sell or bottle that.

I'm not sensitive to caffeine, and generally speaking an energy drink does nothing for me. This however, has beta alanine which will give you the tingles. So buyer beware on that. This is true for any of the C4 flavors that feature a partly yellow can. With that said, I like the tingles, gives me a feeling that the drink is actually doing something. I've bought countless cases and 100, if not 1000s of these in singles from stores."

C4 Energy has been my go-to for that instant burst of energy, especially before hitting the gym. It's like a lightning bolt that wakes me up and gets me pumped for my workout. The flavors are great, and the energy boost is real and immediate.

But here's where it gets even better. I began adding a King Dip pouch to my morning routine, and wow, what a difference! King Dip, known for its testosterone and energy-boosting properties, seems to complement C4 perfectly. While C4 gives me that quick, intense energy, King Dip adds a layer of sustained focus and vitality that lasts throughout the day.

The combination is like having the best of both worlds. The immediate kick from C4 gets me moving, and the long-term benefits from King Dip keep me going. It's not just about physical energy; it's also about mental clarity and focus, which is essential for my busy lifestyle.

I've noticed a significant improvement in my workouts too. The added testosterone support from King Dip seems to help with endurance and strength, making my sessions at the gym more effective. And the best part? No jitters or crash like you might expect from stacking two energy products.

If you're looking for a way to supercharge your mornings and power through your day, give C4 Energy and King Dip a try. This combo has been a game-changer for me, offering the perfect balance of immediate energy and sustained performance enhancement. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast or just someone needing an extra boost, this duo is worth exploring. I got my King Dip off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPN9CZRW"

I needed a replacement for the coffee and tried several energy drinks, that didn't work out and did not taste well. I bought a c4 on a wimb and now, have them delivered by Amazon prime. They give me the get up and wake up, that I need to go everyday."

And it is one of the few performance drinks that does not cause me stomach issues. I like this right before working out. Gives me a smooth and sustained energy boost, and helps hydrate me.

They taste exactly like drinking Starburst, at least as far as I can tell.
Sadly, almost every time I order them there is at least 1 burst and empty can in the package. They have never had any cushioning material in the shipping box. For reasons I cannot figure out this only seems to happen with the Starburst flavor of C4. Other energy drinks (even other types of C4) from Amazon have not had this problem."
