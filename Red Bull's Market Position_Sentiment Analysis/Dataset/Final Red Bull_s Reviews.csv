2,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugar Free, 12 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","April 16, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Taste Seemed Off,"These tasted like they were a reject batch. The flavor was not as full as a typical sugar free redbull would be. The packaging separates them out by packs of 4, so maybe I just had one bad batch.

The energy I get from these is consistent with other SF redbulls that I've drunk before."
3,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugar Free, 12 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","April 14, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Energizing Without the Sugar Rush,"Surviving with a new dietary restriction can be daunting, but Red Bull Sugar Free has seamlessly fit into my adjusted routine. After my doctor advised me to avoid sugar due to diabetes, I found myself missing the familiar kick of energy drinks. However, this sugar-free option has bridged that gap, delivering the same invigorating effect without compromising my health.

Each 8.4 fl oz can is a fusion of caffeine, taurine, and B-vitamins, yet only contains 10 calories. The absence of sugar is ingeniously masked by the use of sweeteners, which means I can enjoy the classic Red Bull taste without the after-effects of a sugar spike. It's become a reliable companion for my daily exercises, offering a sustained boost that helps me maintain my energy levels.

What I appreciate most is the adaptability of this drink. Whether I’m heading out for a brisk walk or settling in for a focused work session, it provides a quick and convenient source of refreshment. The fact that it's wheat-free, gluten-free, and vegetarian adds to its appeal, ensuring it aligns with various dietary needs.

Keeping a stock at home is fuss-free, with the cans easily stored at room temperature and chilled just before consumption. The subtle flavor also pairs well with a meal, making it a versatile choice for different occasions.

In essence, Red Bull Sugar Free has been a positive addition to my lifestyle, offering the essence of an energy drink while staying within my dietary boundaries. Whether for those with specific health concerns or anyone looking for a low-calorie energy boost, this drink checks the boxes without compromising on taste or experience."

Since these have no sugar or sweetners, my main concern is there is no mention of them giving you ENERGY like the ones with sugar? So are these just if you like the taste of Red Bull but don't want the sugar or energy boost? They need to make their product function clearer. I stopped buying them because they were not giving me any energy boost-- so I assume it's like selling coffee but without the caffeine and just for the taste."

85,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugar Free, 12 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","October 23, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Sugar Free Redbull,I ordered a few cases of this to stock my fridge at work and my garage fridge and it all came in tact without issues. Cheapest price I've found per can at the time of order. Tastes great for a morning pick-me-up (I don't really like coffee) and mixes well with vodka.
86,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugar Free, 12 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","October 22, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Balanced Perspective,"The first thing that struck me was the taste. Red Bull Sugar-Free has a familiar flavor profile, which resembles the classic Red Bull energy drink, but without the sugar. The taste was sweet, yet not overly so, and it lacked the syrupy texture that some sugary energy drinks can have. It's a matter of personal preference, but I found it reasonably enjoyable.

One of the main selling points of this product is its sugar-free nature. For individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake or avoid the sugar crashes associated with some energy drinks, Red Bull Sugar-Free is a suitable choice. The absence of sugar is a significant advantage, especially if you're conscious of your daily sugar consumption.

In terms of the energy boost, it was decent but not exceptional. I felt a noticeable increase in alertness and energy, but it didn't provide the same intense jolt as some other high-caffeine energy drinks. For some, this might be a positive aspect, as it can help avoid the jitteriness associated with excessive caffeine intake.

However, it's essential to be aware of the caffeine content in Red Bull Sugar-Free. While it's lower than some other energy drinks, it's still relatively high, and individuals sensitive to caffeine should be cautious.

On the downside, energy drinks like Red Bull Sugar-Free can be relatively expensive compared to other sources of caffeine or energy, such as coffee. Price is a factor that might influence one's decision to purchase this product.

In conclusion, Red Bull Sugar-Free Energy Drink offers a sugar-free alternative with a familiar taste and a moderate energy boost. It's a suitable option for those who enjoy the Red Bull flavor but want to avoid the sugar. However, the cost and caffeine content should be taken into consideration before making a choice. As with any energy drink, it's advisable to consume it in moderation and be mindful of your individual caffeine tolerance."

I have been drinking these a few times a week for 18 years- I noticed something was “off” immediately. The sickeningly sweet aftertaste of sucralose is not appealing to me. I will not be purchasing these anymore.
98,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugar Free, 12 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","October 9, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Unwanted surprise,"I recently bought this red bull drink , and to my disappointment, it didn't live up to its advertised flavor. Despite the promising name, it tasted nothing like peach but rather had an overwhelmingly artificial sweetness that left a strange aftertaste. This unexpected flavor was a major letdown, as I was genuinely looking forward to a peachy refreshment.

On the positive side, it did provide the expected energy boost, thanks to the caffeine and other ingredients. However, the mislabeled flavor is a significant drawback. I hope Red Bull addresses this error to avoid disappointing more customers who, like me, were excited to try the Peach Edition with no sugar."

It contains just a little less caffeine thank an 8 oz of coffee. I rotate drinking coffee with these. Sometimes we need our caffeine in different tastes. I also love the carbonated rush I get from these drinks. These are much cheaper than buying a can at a time at the stores. I am re-ordering these.

Surely they could bring the price down. No alcohol-free 8.4 ounce can of ANYTHING should cost $1.50 a can on sale! Molten gold, maybe."

It's what your body has to adjust to, but limit yourself when drinking these because you may think they are small but too many is not good for you."

472,"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Red Bull Red Edition Watermelon Energy Drink, 8.4 Fl Oz, 24 Cans","May 29, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,If Only it Were Sugar Free or Less Sugar,"I am one person that can't stand energy drinks or companies that promote this junk, but when I saw Watermelon Flavor I just had to try. I am what you call a critic of all energy drinks. They all are horrible tasting, but Red Bull's Watermelon is on another planet in and of itself!

Like some others have said. If this was Sugar Free we'd have energy mania on our hands. This is the best tasting energy drink I have tried.

And is it better than drinking a can of Coke? In my research I found that both aren't really great, but it's the lesser of two evils. Coke has 1.25 ounces more Sugar than Red Bull. While both have Caffeine Red Bull has a substantial serving of that over Coke. And as we all know, Caffeine has several possible negative consequences when consumed in excess.

However, I am digging on this Watermelon and I think if Red Bull listens to its customers and what they have to say they would increase sales by offering a healthier version of this fantastic gem! Woo. So good."

I was happy that it had a little bit of a discount so I made an order for 2 of the 24 cans of the 12 fl oz. Unfortunately, I didn’t get the 2 day shipping that Amazon Prime guarantees. Instead, my order was delivered 1 week late and most of the cans were damaged. I should’ve ordered from Sam’s Club! They had the same deal."

Only was disappointed that when it arrived, it came in a overly large box with two brown pieces of packing paper squished up around the case of Red Bulls. Yeah. Provided no cushioning or support to keep them from being damaged. Several cans were dented up pretty bad and a few were out of the Red Bull case (plastic wrap had ripped) and were in the box.
Aside from that this is a great flavor. Great taste."
