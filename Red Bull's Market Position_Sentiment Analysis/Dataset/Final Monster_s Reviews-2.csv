(the amazon box.) and sticky.

when I opened the Amazon box the Monster box was much smaller and no padding was added, so it must of rolled and tossed in transit..

I was super disappointed, But they refunded me and let me keep the package.. So that was a plus..

This only happened on my very first order.. I've ordered 6 more times and only had 1 dented can. But it was packaged properly.

That is why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star. As it is still hit and miss on it.. But your odds are pretty good.

Also the pack is much smaller now.. you used to get a 24 pack for 25-28 bucks.. now its a 18 pack for 25 bucks.. Not a good deal..

One final thing, if you get headaches drinking this drink at least 3 times the amount of water compared to how much monster you drank, and only ONE monster a day.. If you still get headaches stop drinking and talk to your doctor about this.. (also if you feel irritable moody, or feel fuzzy talk to your doctor.)

Very few people can drink monsters without side effects.. But drink a lot of water, even no-sugar soft drinks can cause kidney stones.. And let me tell you, you do NOT want a kidney stone.. I'm just saying. It's more painful then getting kicked in the nuts by a horse. (yes I know how that feels too.)

Anyways, delicious and good. Just drink responsibly and you'll be fun.. Amazon's customer service is great so if you have any problems ask them. (and take pictures, it helps.)",

I guess it is time to switch to something else. Hansen/Monster.. guess it was good while it lasted. Please listen to your customers and don't change from selling something that customers love.
